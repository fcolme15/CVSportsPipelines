# This is the repository that will hold versions of Computer vision Pipelines for sports use cases.
The goal is to make sports videos into 3d models such that they can be replayed in a fashion such as motion capture. 
This is basically what motion capture is, but implemented solely using computer vision models.
The current implementations use MediaPipe for player/pose detection and YOLO for sports equipment detection.
